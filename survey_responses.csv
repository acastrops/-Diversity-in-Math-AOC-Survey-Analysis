What I did notice though was that there weren't too many courses dedicated to real life application of math concepts. Additionally, and this goes for NCF as a whole, there needs to be gender and racial/ethnic diversity reflected amongst students, faculty, admin. and staff in order to truly be diverse. "

I also am very thankful for all of the professors in the math department. They have always made me feel as capable and supported as I could ever imagine. Changing from studying science to studying philosophy, I'm still in a male-dominated environment and feel that math was much less toxic of an environment for women. I feel that women just tend to have a harder time doing things that are deemed to be more ""useless"" in society's eye (i.e. math and philosophy due to their abstract nature) and perhaps just celebrating the uniqueness of these more abstract subjects and educating first-year students on the nature of these subjects and the styles of thinking and approach that are taken would be good for women to hear. Instead of hearing their area of interest is useless and diverting them from it, they could hear that people like to think about theory (for instance, in philosophy) and the way things work in the world would like to be a part of the program.

I am also so happy this survey went out! There is a similar mechanism in the philosophy department due to the gender disparity and I am very glad it is happening here now. Thanks for all you all do!"

==On Diversity, and How It Has Been Misinterpreted==
A response to the Diversity and Mathematics Survey

--1) Sapere Aude--

While well-intentioned, this survey is an example of a problem that I see occurring throughout certain facets of society in recent years. Yes, it is true that there are more men than women working in STEM, and yes, it is true that there are more whites and Asians working in STEM than other ethnic groups, but to chock this up entirely to discrimination seems excessive. People have become obsessed with the idea that crypto-racism and crypto-sexism are the driving forces behind modern Western nations, which couldn't be further from the truth.

To be blunt, Western culture is one of the least discriminatory cultures on Earth. Obviously, discrimination in Western countries still exists, I will never deny that (in fact, it will never be fully eliminated anywhere), but compared to many other locales, the West is characterized by being much more accepting of different perspectives, religions, creeds, races, LGBT people, et cetera. So to claim that the West does not, in fact, support diverse groups of people is a very serious accusation, and one that would need to have strong evidence supporting it.

If you read my responses to the questions, you will see that I refused to specify my gender and ethnicity. That is because those should not be factors in considering my arguments. I could be anyone, because everyone should believe this.

--2) Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?--

My ideals are Enlightenment ideals, the very ones modern Western society is founded upon. These ideals are Liberty, Progress, Tolerance, and Fraternity.

Liberty is the lack of arbitrary restrains on individuals. Progress is the ability of people to improve their own lives. Tolerance is the acceptance of others despite being able to not do so. Fraternity is solidarity between people.

These are the ideals that, as previously stated, modern Western society is founded upon. And yet, some people still believe that these are not, in fact, the ideals that we cherish, and that groups of people are actively held back in their advancement. I will give you that, yes, this was true at one point, but I strongly believe that we are past that. I shall now deconstruct arguments that there is an active push to hold back certain groups from achieving success, and show that the full picture is one of fearmongering.

--3) A Vindication of the Rights of Woman--

Most people are aware that men and women are equally capable in mathematics; it is rather unpopular to claim otherwise. Men and women are both seen as being capable of accomplishing many of the same tasks by the majority of Western society, because, while we have a past of preventing women from holding the same positions as men, Western society has evolved past this point, and treats men and women on the same intellectual footing.

So if women have the same intellectual capabilities as men, why are there fewer women in STEM? Surely, if men and women are in a roughly 1:1 ratio, then there should be a roughly 1:1 ratio of men to women in STEM fields, and yet there is not. In the United States, roughly 25% of STEM workers are women, and this is after promotion of women in STEM had began. On the surface, this is incredibly unexpected, but there is an explanation.

Mathematical ability can be developed regardless of if your sex, so to claim that men are better at mathematics than women is incorrect. However, it is true that, on average, men have more interest in mathematics than women. I would like to stress that this is not stating that ""all men are more interested in mathematics"" or ""no woman is interested in mathematics."" This is merely a statement that, *ON AVERAGE*, men are more interested in mathematics than women. To force women who happen to not be interested in STEM into the field is counterproductive.

But, if women are not interested in STEM, the obvious question is why. The answer lies in the fact that, *ON AVERAGE*, male and female personalities are dimorphic. The factor most relevant to the STEM question is the dichotomy between empathizing and systemizing. *ON AVERAGE* females tend to have personalities tailored to empathizing, and *ON AVERAGE* males tend to have personalities tailored to systemizing. Since STEM is almost entirely based around rigorous systems, of course men would be more likely to be a part of STEM. I would also like to stress that, between empathizing and systemizing, neither is superior to the other; they are merely different personality types. Do not interpret this as me saying that women are inferior because they are empathetic, or that men are superior because they can naturally systemize.

Despite this, many people claim that women are not interested in STEM because they have what some refer to as ""internalized misogyny,"" which is the idea that they have been made subservient by ""the Patriarchy."" Of course, this is just narrative-pushing. If anything, women who enter STEM because they feel that they are ""supposed to,"" despite not wanting to, are the real victims here. Women who do not want to participate in STEM fields should never feel ashamed that they are not interested in them.

--4) !ke e: ?xarra ?ke--

This survey gives the implication that there is a sizeable portion of people who believe that, as the survey put it, ""some racial/ethnic groups are generally better suited to mathematics than others."" To claim this is true is outright racism. No ethnic group is overtly superior to any other group, and no ethnic group is overtly inferior to any other. Any discrepancies in standardized test scores between ethnic groups can easily be attributed to other factors, mostly economic in nature, such as a lack of quality education in low-income neighborhoods. Anyone seriously claiming that one race is inherently better/worse than another is racist, plain and simple.

So how does this answer the question of ethnic minorities in STEM? As mentioned earlier, the reason there are fewer minorities is that, *ON AVERAGE*, ethnic minorities are economically worse off than whites (and, in recent years, Asians). This is not, as some claim, because there is a concerned effort to impoverish minorities. Rather, it has to do with the fact that, historically, ethnic minorities were treated as second-class citizens, with the most extreme case being the enslavement of African-Americans. However, despite the fact that minorities have legally been elevated to the same standing as whites, the economic impact of their prior status is readily apparent. Many are stuck in low-income neighborhoods, and do not have access to the level of education necessary to succeed in STEM.

My issue is that people look at the large concentrations of minorities that are not in STEM and assume that it is because they are blocked from entering the field by racism. If this were true, the entire STEM field would be under intense scrutiny, as we live in a society where being a bigot is one of the worst things you can be (as it should be). The truth is that, if you want more minorities in STEM, you would have to elevate the economic status of the many minority people who are trapped in an economic hell, and that is no easy feat.

As a side note, also take into account the key word: ""minority."" There will always be fewer minorities in STEM, because there are less of them in general. If there weren't, they wouldn't be minorities. Keep this in mind.

--5) ??????? ???????? ? ????????? ??? ????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ??????? ???? ?????? ??????? ??? ?????? ??????????? ?????????? --

The general response by businesses in the STEM field to these deficiencies in hiring has been to establish ""diversity quotas."" These quotas look for certain ratios of groups of people in the workplace, and people can be denied a position merely for being the wrong kind of person. This reduction of people to token characteristics, aside from being the definition of discrimination, is completely antithetical to the principle of hiring the best possible applicants for the job.

You might be wondering why I care so much about this issue. The reason is that it is taboo to discuss it. Whenever anyone brings up an issue like this and goes against the narrative, they are shut down, at best. Another possible scenario is being fired, which has been documented to occur. The most notable recent incident has been the firing of James Damore from Google for publishing an internal memo criticizing how Google only cared about the appearance of diversity, manifested in tokenism, but did not care about diversity of thought. In response to him publishing the memo, he was fired, completely justifying his comments that Google has created an echo chamber.

The only reason I feel safe in publishing this is because this is an anonymous survey, and others cannot see who I am. If I did not have the guarantee of privacy, I would fear retribution, not by the administration, but by other students.

I strongly feel that Enlightenment values are at risk of becoming obsolete. If this were true, we would have a culture run by irrationality, by fear, by blind faith in leaders, and by antidemocracy. These go against the core beliefs of New College's philosophy.

--6) ??--

I want New College to be an environment where free discussion can foster, not a place where the opposition lives in fear.

I want the oppressors of open thought to be combated, and for the silent to have a voice.

I want people to be treated as individuals, not reduced to exploitable labels.

I want the personal choices of individuals not be dictated by what they are ""supposed to do"" in order to give an illusion of progress that is perverted beyond repair.

I want people to recognize that Enlightenment values are at the core of our society, and to practice them.

I want normalcy."

I perform average,possibly below average, on calc III and some students ask me for help based on the stereotype that Asians are good at math. It really discourages me since my average performance in calc is not what the other students expect. I often get comments like ""really? You did worse than I did, that's suprising"". It's a microaggression that makes failure seem more daunting than it really is. Because of this, I often shy away from math despite the fact that I need more help."
